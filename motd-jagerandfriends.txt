----- INFOS ABOUT GAMEPLAY -----
1. Spawn with a Ship you like.  Mining [M] ; Trading [T] ; Fighting [W] ; Survival [S] ( The normal Game )
2. Explore, trade, mine, fight, join a faction, buy ship components, upgrade your Ship AND have fun!

-----  INFOS ABOUT MODS AND PLANNED CHANGES -----
Spawn: The planetary landers are spawning mid-space. We are currently figuring out, how we can fix this. The Ships work fine.
                To get you the survival option, we placed a emergency-medbay on the earth with some landers an wrecks.
Ice-processing-mod: The hydrogen generators are very OP and will be removed in the next days, so don't build ships that rely on these generators.
Nanite-System: This Mod drags much server performance, so please build only one per player and turn them off, if you don't use them. THANKS!  :)
